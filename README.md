# CIS3490-Practice

###Update : I htink mock exam 1 questions were good, but the solution key was wonky. I've replaced mock exam 1 with another and the correct solution key (well, as fas as Ai says it is).

This repo contains mock exams to prepare for the final exam. The exam covers all the material in the course but places emphasis on the content post midterm.

I claim no ownership of the content. It was entirely generated by AI and NOT verified. Use at your own peril.
It is simply a study tool that spans all the course content (notes), labs, assignments and quizzes.

You disagree with the solution key and the correct answer? Well, maybe that means you know your shit, or maybe you don't know shit... but the solution key is also AI generated and AI feels that is the correct answer - again, use at your own peril. There will be no revision of the answer key or questions, but consider it a worthy exercise to go check course content and find the definitive answer.

Good luck on the final!
